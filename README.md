# rust-backend-starter

A modular, clean architecture **boilerplate** for building backend RESTful APIs in Rust using [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/).  
This project aims to provide a scalable, easy-to-understand code structure for rapid backend development with Rust, inspired by best practices from Node.js/Express and Go.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Clean folder structure**: Separation of concerns by domain, business logic, and application layer.
- **REST API ready**: Start building endpoints out of the box.
- **Modular codebase**: Easily extend services, controllers, and domain models.
- **Built-in serialization**: Using Serde for JSON request/response.
